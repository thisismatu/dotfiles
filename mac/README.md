## Scripts

This folder contains two scripts:

- [audit.command](audit.command) - MacOS hardening audit script
- [defaults.sh](defaults.sh) - Set MacOS defaults to my liking

To run either script, make sure they are executable:

```sh
chmod +x audit.command
```

## Terminal theme

This folder also contains my preferred Terminal theme, [Cuicca](Cuicca.terminal). To use it, open the file and click on the "Import" button in the Terminal preferences.
